# API Endpoint Plan

**Project:** Race/Event Management System
**Part:** 1 — Endpoint Planning (based on ERD: User, Participant, Organiser, Club, Event, Category, Discipline, Registration, Result, ClubMembership)

Each account has exactly one subtype: Participant or Organiser. Public self-registration creates Participant accounts only. Organiser accounts are created by an authorised administrator, who issues a temporary password; the organiser must change it at first login. Only the two account roles in this plan call protected endpoints.

## 1. Authentication

| POST | `/api/admin/organisers` | Provision an Organiser account; generate or set a one-time temporary password and require password change at first login | Authorised administrator | `{ email, first_name, last_name, id_number_or_passport }` | `201 Created` — organiser invitation or temporary credential delivered through the approved secure channel |

## 7. Additional Supporting Endpoints

These endpoints support the `Discipline`, `Club`, and `ClubMembership` entities in the ERD. Organisers create disciplines and register clubs; these are Organiser permissions and do not introduce a third account role.

| HTTP Method | Route | Description | Role Required | Request Body | Expected Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/disciplines` | List all available sporting disciplines | Public | — | `200 OK` — array of disciplines |
| POST | `/api/disciplines` | Add a sporting discipline | Organiser | `{ name, description }` | `201 Created` — discipline object; `409 Conflict` if name already exists |

| POST | `/api/clubs` | Register a new club | Organiser | `{ name, registration_number, contact_email, contact_number }` | `201 Created` — club object; `409 Conflict` if name or registration number already exists |
| GET | `/api/clubs/{clubId}` | Get details of a specific club | Public | — | `200 OK` — club object |
| POST | `/api/clubs/{clubId}/memberships` | Join a club under a specific sporting discipline | Participant | `{ discipline_id, membership_number, joined_at }` | `201 Created` — membership object; `409 Conflict` if already a member for that discipline; `404 Not Found` if club absent |

## Notes on error responses

All endpoints additionally return, where applicable: `400 Bad Request` (validation failure), `401 Unauthorized` (missing/invalid token), `403 Forbidden` (wrong role or not the resource owner), and `404 Not Found` (resource does not exist). `409 Conflict` is used for uniqueness or capacity conflicts, including duplicate registrations and full categories. Because registrations are retained and uniquely constrained after cancellation, a participant cannot re-enrol in the same category after cancelling; a new category/entry or an explicit policy change is needed.
